DESCRIPTION 
Introduction:
The Chess vs AI game in Python is an interactive program that allows a player to play a game of chess against an artificial intelligence opponent. It uses the rules of chess to provide a realistic and challenging gaming experience.

Key Components:

    Chessboard Representation: The game uses a 2D array or a similar data structure to represent the chessboard. Each square on the board can contain a piece (like a pawn, knight, bishop, etc.) or be empty.

    Player Input: The player interacts with the game by specifying their moves using algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 to e4"). Input validation ensures that the moves are legal according to the rules of chess.

    AI Opponent: The AI opponent is responsible for making its own moves. It uses algorithms and heuristics to evaluate positions and select the best move. Common AI algorithms for chess include minimax with alpha-beta pruning, and more advanced techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

    Game Logic: The game logic manages the state of the chessboard, enforces the rules of chess, and checks for conditions like checkmate, stalemate, or a draw. It also keeps track of the game's history for purposes like undoing moves or checking for threefold repetition.

    User Interface: A simple graphical user interface (GUI) or a text-based interface can be implemented to display the chessboard, allow player input, and provide feedback on the game's progress.

Libraries Used:

    Python's built-in data structures and control flow for the core logic.
